## Overview

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 850 million people worldwide and often goes undetected until it's too late. This project trained and compared five classification models to predict CKD in early stages using routine blood and urine tests. By analyzing 400 patient records with 24 clinical features, we identified the most interpretable and accurate model to enable early detection in primary care settings.

**Goal:** Enable physicians to detect CKD early so that preventative measures can be taken.

## Key Results

### Default Model Performance (5-Fold Cross-Validation)
All models exceeded clinical targets (Sensitivity >95%, Specificity >90%, ROC-AUC >0.95):

| Model | Sensitivity | Specificity | Accuracy | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 98.67% ± 1.63% | 98.00% ± 2.19% | 98.25% | 0.9771 | 0.9992 |
| SVM | 98.00% ± 1.63% | 98.40% ± 1.50% | 98.25% | 0.9768 | 0.9993 |
| XGBoost | 97.33% ± 3.89% | 98.80% ± 0.98% | 98.25% | 0.9763 | 0.9976 |
| Random Forest | 96.00% ± 3.27% | 99.20% ± 0.98% | 98.00% | 0.9728 | 0.9995 |
| Decision Tree | 94.67% ± 3.40% | 95.20% ± 2.99% | 95.00% | 0.9344 | 0.9493 |

### Tuned Model Performance (After Hyperparameter Optimization)
Performance using 5-fold stratified cross-validation with optimized hyperparameters:

| Model | Sensitivity | Specificity | Accuracy | F1-Score | Total Errors |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **SVM** (C=10.0, kernel=rbf, gamma=0.1) | **98.67%** | **98.80%** | **98.75%** | **0.9834** | **5** |
| **Logistic Regression** (C=0.1, solver=lbfgs) | 99.33% | 97.60% | 98.25% | 0.9770 | 7 |
| **XGBoost** (n_est=200, depth=3, lr=0.05) | 96.67% | 98.80% | 98.00% | 0.9732 | 8 |

**Statistical Testing:** McNemar's test confirmed all top models are statistically equivalent (p > 0.05). **SVM recommended** for deployment with 98.75% accuracy (5 errors: 3 FP, 2 FN). Logistic Regression offers strong interpretability with 98.25% accuracy (7 errors).

## 🔍 Top Predictive Features (SHAP Analysis)

Feature importance analysis across models identified:
1. **Hemoglobin** - Anemia marker (clinically validated)
2. **Specific Gravity** - Kidney concentration ability
3. **Packed Cell Volume (PCV)** - Another anemia indicator
4. **Albumin** - Protein in urine (kidney damage marker)

**Clinical Validation:** Anemia markers ranking highly aligns with CKD pathophysiology, confirming model trustworthiness.

**Note:** Serum Creatinine showed model-dependent importance (#1 in Random Forest, #11 in Logistic Regression), demonstrating the value of comparing multiple approaches.

---

## 🏥 Why This Matters

- **90% of people with CKD are unaware they have it** (asymptomatic early stages)
- Disease progression causes **irreversible damage** requiring dialysis or transplantation
- **Dialysis costs $90,000+ per patient per year**
- Early intervention with medication and lifestyle changes can **slow or stop progression**
- Our models use **only routine tests** already available in primary care (no additional cost)

## 📁 Dataset

**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/336/chronic+kidney+disease) - Apollo Hospitals, India (July-Nov 2015)

- **400 patients**, 24 clinical features
- **Class distribution:** 250 CKD (62.5%), 150 Not CKD (37.5%)
- **Features:** Hemoglobin, Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea, Albumin, Specific Gravity, Blood Pressure, Age, etc.
- **Missing data:** 10.12% (handled with kNN imputation)

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### Pipeline
1. **EDA:** Correlation analysis, distribution plots, outlier detection (IQR method)
2. **Preprocessing:** kNN imputation (k=5), LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, outlier retention (clinical significance)
3. **Modeling:** 5 algorithms with 5-fold stratified cross-validation using scikit-learn pipelines
4. **Optimization:** GridSearchCV with F1-scoring (balanced performance)
5. **Evaluation:** Comprehensive metrics + McNemar's statistical testing + SHAP interpretability

### Key Design Decisions
- **StandardScaler** over MinMaxScaler (robust to outliers, better for LR/SVM)
- **5-fold CV** over train/test split (small dataset, reduces variance, maximizes data use)
- **kNN imputation** (preserves feature relationships vs. simple mean/median)
- **Retained outliers** (clinical data - extreme values can indicate severe disease)
- **F1-optimization** (balanced Sensitivity/Specificity vs. Recall-only which produced 37 errors)

## 🎯 Key Findings & Recommendations

### Clinical Insights
1. **All models exceeded performance targets** - CKD prediction is feasible with routine tests
2. **Logistic Regression identified as optimal** - balances accuracy with interpretability
3. **Anemia markers crucial** - Hemoglobin, PCV consistently ranked high across models
4. **Simple models work** - LR performance suggests CKD is a relatively linear classification problem

### Deployment Recommendation
**Deploy SVM (C=10.0, kernel=rbf, gamma=0.1) or XGBoost (n_estimators=200, max_depth=3)** for clinical use:
- ✅ **98.75% Accuracy** (SVM with 5 errors on 400-sample dataset)
- ✅ **98.67% Sensitivity** (catches 98.67% of CKD cases)
- ✅ **98.80% Specificity** (minimal false alarms)
- ✅ Validated through rigorous 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- ✅ Statistically equivalent performance (McNemar's test p > 0.05)

**Alternative:** Logistic Regression (C=0.1) offers 98.25% accuracy with interpretability if physicians need to understand feature weights, with 7 errors and 99.33% sensitivity.
